Part 1 - Split the Address
16 bit virtual addresses
Each page has 2^8  = 256 addressable locations

How many bits is the offset?
    8 bits, since each page has 256 locations, which is addressable by 8 bits

How many bits for the VPN?
    all the rest of the bits so 16 - 8 = 8

What is the VPN given the address 0xBEEF?
    0xBEEF -> 0xBE = 1011 1011

What is the offset given the address 0xBEEF?
    0xBEEF -> -0xEF = 1110 1111
