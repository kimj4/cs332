1. What is the page size on this computer?

    4096 bytes

2. According to vm_stat, how much memory (in GB) is in pages that are active?
   How does this compare to "memory used" in activity monitor?

    memory in active pages: 4.892 GB
    memory used: 6.11 GB

3. According to vm_stat, how much memory (in GB) is in pages wired down?
   How does this compare to "wired memory" in activity monitor?

    memory in wired down pages 2.244 GB
    wired memory: 2.11 GB

4. Why is the amount of memory in pages given by vm_stat slightly different
   that the amount of memory given by activity monitor for the categories in
   the 2 above questions? Will the number given by vm_stat always be larger or
   smaller than the number from activity monitor? Or could it be either?

   'memory in active pages' and 'memory used' is different since the activity
   monitor is combining app memory and wired memory for its metric. vm_stat's
   active pages will always be a smaller value since it counts the two
   separately.

   The difference in the wired memory is small enough that I can reasonably
   attribute it to variations between polling times. I think either one could
   be larger at any given time

5. Which categories in vm_stat are included in the "cache" category in activity
   monitor?

6. Which cateogry in vm_stat corresponds to "compressed" memory used in activity
   monitor?

7. How does the number of pageins compare to pageouts? Why is this the case?

8. What is the difference between swap in/out and page in/out? Which is most
   important for determining if your system has enough RAM to function
   smoothly/quickly?
