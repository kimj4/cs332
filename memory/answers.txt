1. What is the page size on this computer?

    4096 bytes

2. According to vm_stat, how much memory (in GB) is in pages that are active?
   How does this compare to "memory used" in activity monitor?

    memory in active pages: 4.892 GB
    memory used: 6.11 GB

3. According to vm_stat, how much memory (in GB) is in pages wired down?
   How does this compare to "wired memory" in activity monitor?

    memory in wired down pages 2.244 GB
    wired memory: 2.11 GB

4. Why is the amount of memory in pages given by vm_stat slightly different
   that the amount of memory given by activity monitor for the categories in
   the 2 above questions? Will the number given by vm_stat always be larger or
   smaller than the number from activity monitor? Or could it be either?

   'memory in active pages' and 'memory used' is different since the activity
   monitor is combining app memory and wired memory for its metric. vm_stat's
   active pages will always be a smaller value since it counts the two
   separately.

   The difference in the wired memory is small enough that I can reasonably
   attribute it to variations between polling times. I think either one could
   be larger at any given time

5. Which categories in vm_stat are included in the "cache" category in activity
   monitor?

   From an Apple article, 'Cached Files' is memory that's been recently used and
   then freed. Other processes can use it, but if the same process restarts,
   they won't have to load it into RAM again.

   pages inactive,

6. Which cateogry in vm_stat corresponds to "compressed" memory used in activity
   monitor?

   'Compressions'

7. How does the number of pageins compare to pageouts? Why is this the case?

   There are 429550 Pageins and 0 pageouts.
   Pageins are reading stuff from disk to memory and pageouts is the opposite.
   Pageins need to happen regularly to run various programs, but pageouts only
   need to happen if all of the memory is used and some of the pages have to be
   stored in disk until there is available space again.

8. What is the difference between swap in/out and page in/out? Which is most
   important for determining if your system has enough RAM to function
   smoothly/quickly?

   Swapping in and out means that whole processes are being pushed and popped
   out of the disk while paging is for individual pages.

   Paging is probably the better metric to measure if there is enough RAM since
   swapping can happen to any computer if a program that requires a lot of
   memory is run. If you have a lot of paging out, then it probably means that
   individual processes are running out of memory.
