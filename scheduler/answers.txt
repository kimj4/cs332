Q1: Run the FIFO OS simulation with 1, 2, and 4CPUs. Compare the total execution
    time of each. Is there a linear relationship between the number of CPUs and
    total execution time? Why or why not?

    1: 99 context switches, 67.6 s running time, 389.9 s in READY state
    2: 108 context switches, 35.8 s running time, 92.2 s in READY state
    4: 182 context switches, 33.1 s running time, 0.2s in READY state

    There is not a linear relationship between the number of CPUs and the total
    execution time. There was a significant performance increase going from 1
    to 2 CPUs but almost no change going from 2 to 4. This is because the number
    of processes being run does not change. So while more things can be run
    simultaneously, they are not, because the processes are not even on the
    READY state.

    One observation to support this is the fact that in the simulation, nearly
    every single timestep had CPUs at idle.


Q2: Run your Round-Robin scheduler with timeslices of 800ms, 600ms, 400ms, and
    200ms. Use only one CPU for your tests. Compare the statistcs at the end of
    the simulation. Show that the total waiting time decreases with shorter
    timeslices. However, in a real OS, the shortest timeslice possible is
    usually not the best choice. Why not?

    200ms: 362 context switches, 67.6s total running time, 285.2s in READY state
    400ms: 203 context switches, 67.6s total running time, 298.8s in READY state
    600ms: 161 context switches, 67.6s total running time, 314.5s in READY state
    800ms: 136 context switches, 67.6s total running time, 325.4s in READY state

Q3: The Shortest-Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm is proven to have the
    optimal average waiting time. However, it is only a theoretical algorithm;
    it cannot be implemented in a typical CPU scheduler, because the scheduler
    does not have advance knowledge of the length of each CPU burst. Run each of
    your three scheduling algorithms (using one CPU), and compare the total
    waiting times. Which algorithm is the closest approximation of SJF? Why?

    static_priority run:
        168 context switches, 68.8s total running time, 137.1s in READY state
